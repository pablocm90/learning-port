# Hello Word,

I guess the joke must be made by everyone that starts something like I am attempting here! 

## What I am attempting: 

To create a repository of both code snippets and blog posts to document and serve as a future reference (to me and hopefully to others) of my progress through code and computer science.

## Motivation
The best way to commit to what I am learning is to write about it and have a space to experiment with it. 

This repo and website are aimed towards that.

If you have ideas, suggestions, constructive criticism of my code, whatever, please do contact me!

## Study Plan
It is not yet fully developed, but it should include: 

 OOP | Algorithms | Databases | General CS | Web Development

The above is not a completed or comprehensive list, and it is not in a deliberate order.

## Practice
The idea is to set up this learning environment in an overly complicated and unnecessarily overengineered blog format.

## The rationale behind this is twofold:
  1. Apply the principles I can apply practically (sometimes at the expense of 'real need')
  2. Although I can use my learning in a practical manner here, I wish to write about it.
