## Motivation

I feel that the best way to commit to what I am learning is to write about it and to have a space to experiment about it.
This repo an website are aimed towards that.

If you have ideas, suggetions, constructive criticism of my code, whatever please do contact me!

## Study Plan

It is not yes fully developed but it shoud include OOP | Algorithms | Databases | General CS | Web Development

The above is not a completed or comprehensive list and it is not in a deliberate order.

## Practice

The idea is to set up this learning environment in an overtly complex and unecessarily overengineered and overthought blog format.

The rationale behind this is double:

  1. Apply the principles I can apply in a practical manner (sometimes at the expense of 'real need')
  2. Regardless of the fact that I can apply my learning in a practical manner here, I wish to be able to write about it.

## Reading List

Comming soon
